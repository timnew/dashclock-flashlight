Dash Clock - Flashlight 
====================

Just as the other android flashlight apps do, Dash Clock - Flashlight enables the users to use their phone as flashlight. 

The difference is that Dash Clock - Flashlight insn't an indepnendant app but a plug-in for the awesome android desktop widget [Dash Clock](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.nurik.roman.dashclock).

To use the plug-in, you need to add the plug in into the Dash Clock. To turn on/off the flashlight, just simply click the light bulb icon.
